# WT32-SqLn
Getting started with Wireless Tag's WT32-SC01 Plus using SquareLine Studio, LVGL, and OTA updates.

## Overview
I recently bought a WT32-SC01 Plus but quickly grew frustrated when it came time to use it.
I found plenty of YouTube videos demonstrating it's amazing screen and performance,
all in an under-$30 device. After plenty of digging and experiments and frustrating hours,
here's a detailed description of what I learned. Further contributions welcomed.

## What you need to know right now

1. It uses a ESP32-S3 WROVER, not a ESP32 VROOM.
1. It is not supported by the latest Arduino IDE
1. You can't program it using the USB-C port
1. You can't power it using the USB-to-serial board only

## What you'll need

or

1. A [WT32-SC01 Plus board](https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256803559528956.html) without programmer
1. A [3.3V USB-to-Serial communication board](https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256803764808791.html)
1. [7-pin MX1.25 PicoBlade dongles](https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256804401152079.html) (get some 8-pin ones too if you plan on using GPIOs)

and:

1. [ESP-IDF v5.0](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32/get-started/index.html)
1. [SquareLine Studio](https://squareline.io)
1. USB-C 2A power supply

## Programming

Unlike other ESP32 development boards, you can't program the WT32-SC01 Plus using the USB-C port.
That port is only for supplying power.
You *HAVE TO* use the serial port and trigger the programming mode using EN and GPIO0.
As the programmer wasn't included with the board, it was a particularly frustrating step.

If you bought the version that includes the programmer, you can skip to the "[Using the WT programmer](#using-the-wt-programmer)" section.

### Using your own USB-to-serial board

Using a 7-pin MX1.25 PicoBlade dongle and a 2.54mm/0.1" pin header connector housing that matches your board,
create a cable to connect the TX, RX, and GND pins on the Debug Interface
to the RX, TX, and GND pins respectively on your USB-to-serial communication board,
and using a *separate* 1-pin connector housing, connect the GPIO0 pin on the Debug Interface
to a *second* exposed GND pin on your USB-to-serial communication board.
It is important that it be possible to disconnect the GPIO0 wire from the USB-to-serial board
without disconnecting the other wires.

##### Debug Interface on WT32-SC01 Plus
| Pin | Description | ESP32 Pin | Voltage Range | Remark
| --- | ----------- | --------- | ------------- | ------
| 1 | +5V | | 5V | USB-to-serial not sufficient as power source
| 2 | +3.3V | | 3.3V | For reference, not for power input
| 3 | ESP_TXD | TXD0 | 3.3V TTL |
| 4 | ESP_RXD | RXD0 | 3.3V TTL |
| 5 | EN | EN | 0-3.3V |
| 6 | BOOT | GPIO 0 | 0-3.3V | 
| 7 | GND | | 0V |

Here's my DIY programming cable.
I did connect the 5V line so I could easily identify which side of the connector was "up": the red wire goes with the VCC pin.
Notice how the white "GPIO0" wire is connected to a separate exposed GND pin on the programmer.

The following steps assume you have an application succesfully compiled using `idf.py build` (see [Build This Example](#build-this-example) section).
To program, then run your application with the serial monitor, power the WT32-SC01 Plus via its own
USB-C port as well as connecting your serial board to a USB port on your computer.

1. To enter programming mode, connect the GPIO0 wire to the GND pin, then press the `RST` button on the back
of the WT32-SC01 Plus.

1. Flash your application using the command `idf.py flash`. Wait until the flashing process completes with a `Hard resetting via RTS pin...` message.
   Skip to step 5 if you are not using the serial monitor to debug your application.

1. Leave the GPIO0 wire connected to the GND pin and reset the WT32-SC01 Plus again.

1. Start the serial monitor using the command `idf.py monitor`. Wait until the monitor is running indicated by the following message:

```
--- idf_monitor on /dev/cu.wchusbserial54340143141 115200 ---
--- Quit: Ctrl+] | Menu: Ctrl+T | Help: Ctrl+T followed by Ctrl+H ---
```

5. To run your application, disconnect the GPIO0 wire, then reset the WT32-SC01 Plus again.

### Using the WT programmer

If you were fortunate enough to order a WT32-SC01 Plus that came with its own custom programmer, TBD

## OTA Updates

The example application includes over-the-air (OTA) update cability.
Once the example application is flashed once using the serial communication board,
you can use OTA updates instead for subsequent updates but takes longer to flash (approx 2mins).

1. Build the latest version of the application using the command `idf.py build`

1. Start the OTA server using the command `python webserver`

1. Reset your WT32-SC01 Plus

1. While the splash screen is displayed, tap the project name 5 times to trigger an OTA upgrade.
   For the upgrade to complete succesfully, you must have specified your WiFi credentials and OTA server certificate when building.

## Squareline Studio

To add support for the WT32-SC01 Plus, copy the content of the `SquareLine/boards` directory into your Squareline Studio installation using the command

```
$ cp -r SquareLine/boards/* <Path to Squareline Studio installation>/boards
```

e.g. on my Mac:

```
$ cp -r SquareLine/boards/* /Applications/Squareline_Studio.app/Contents/boards
```

## Building This Example

After cloning this respository:

1. Set your target device using the command `idf.py set-target esp32s3`

2. Generate a self-signed certificate for the OTA https server using the command `openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout ca_key.pem -out ca_cert.pem -days 365 -nodes`.
   When prompted for the `Common Name (CN)`, enter the IP address of the server that the WT32-SC01 Plus will connect to.

3. Copy the file `secrets.h` into the 'main' directory, and edit it to specify your Wifi credentials and OTA server certificate.
   The certificate can be found in the file `server_certs/ca_cert.pem`.
   ToDo: replace with menuconfig and get the certificate compiled into the binary directly.

4. Build the demo application using the command `idf.py build`

## ToDo

* Add my code
* Get my code configurable using menuconfig

## 3D-Printed Cases

In the 3Dprint directory, you'll find STL files for 3D-printable cases

* BatteryCase: Compact case that can fit the WT32-SC01 Plus, a [3.7V lithium-ion battery](https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256803919111184.html), a [charger module](https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256804193670438.html), and a [power switch](https://www.aliexpress.us/item/2251832642923360.html).
  The USB-C opening and tabs to hold the charger module still need some tweaking.
